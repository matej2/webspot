# WebSpot

A responsive and visually appealing static webpage built with HTML and CSS for my former business. This project showcases my frontend development skills, including clean code structure, modern design principles, and cross-device compatibility. While my primary expertise lies in backend development with Java and Python, this project reflects my ability to create functional and user-friendly web interfaces.
